# ChatGPTApp

This is a version of OpenAPI, that works with the DavinciText model, which is mostly appropriate to handle generic questions.

The benefit of this specific app is that it's developed on Blazor and allows to port the WebApp to Android or iOS native apps.

You don't need to provide any credentials or go through a login process, just need to generate an API key in openapi.com and place it in the OpenAPIService.cs file.
